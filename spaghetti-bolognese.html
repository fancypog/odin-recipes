    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>Ground meat (beef, pork, or a combination)</li>
        <li>Onion (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>Garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>Tomatoes (fresh or canned)</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Spaghetti noodles</li>
        <li>Herbs (such as oregano and basil)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>Optional garnishes: Parmesan cheese, fresh herbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Prepare Ingredients
            <p>Gather the necessary ingredients, including ground meat (typically beef or a mix), onions, garlic, tomatoes (fresh or canned), tomato paste, herbs (such as oregano and basil), and spaghetti noodles. Optionally, have Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs for garnish.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 2: Sauté Aromatics
            <p>In a large skillet or saucepan, sauté finely chopped onions and minced garlic in olive oil until softened and aromatic. This forms the flavorful base of the Bolognese sauce.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3: Brown the Meat
            <p>Add the ground meat to the pan, breaking it apart with a spatula as it browns. Cook until the meat is well-browned, ensuring it develops a rich flavor.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 4: Tomato Base
            <p>Incorporate tomatoes and tomato paste into the meat mixture. Stir well, allowing the ingredients to meld. Simmer until the tomatoes break down and the sauce thickens.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 5: Season and Simmer
            <p>Season the sauce with salt, pepper, and herbs to taste. Reduce the heat to low and let the Bolognese sauce simmer, allowing the flavors to intensify. This slow-cooking process enhances the depth of taste.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 6: Cook Spaghetti
            <p>While the sauce simmers, cook the spaghetti noodles according to the package instructions. Aim for al dente, as the noodles will continue to cook slightly when combined with the sauce.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 7: Combine and Serve
            <p>Once the Bolognese sauce reaches a rich consistency, toss the cooked spaghetti into the pan, ensuring the noodles are evenly coated. Serve the spaghetti Bolognese hot, garnished with Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs if desired.</p>
